# 📱 Flutter Additional Requirements

# 👾 Dependencies/Architecture

There are no constraints on what to use and why.\
You can use as many dependencies as you like and use the architecture of your
choice.

But you will be expected to justify your decision.

# 🚀 Starting the project

The project is expected to start using the following command:

```sh
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Additional steps are allowed (code-generators?), but the process needs to be
documented in the README.

# 🐛 UX requirements

While implementing the user stories, all loading and errors states are expected
to be gracefully handled.

This can be a simple spinner while loading and an "Oops" screen on error, but there
need to be something.

# ☑️ Submission checklist

- [ ] Project is provided as zipped directory, not as a link to a repository
      (we prefer that you don't host the project in a public repo).
- [ ] Project builds out of the box and runs on both an Android emulator and an
      iOS Simulator without crashes.
- [ ] All AC met for TAB-001.
- [ ] All AC met for TAB-002.
- [ ] All additional requirements from this file met.
